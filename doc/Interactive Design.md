In this part, we take a fresh, interactive approach to telling our data story with Shiny. It can allow users to interact with our data and our analysis. Furthermore, we can see the different relationship between each two variables through the scatter plot (we are also able to choose jitter or smooth).For example, we can choose iyear as x-axis and region as y-axis to see the total number terrorism attacks in each region by year. You can also choose the mouth as color  to compare the different performance in each month. 

So far, we used the interactive plot to show the terrorism attack information in each year. In the future, we would like to explore deeper and try different visualization tools to compare. For example, we are going to create a map to see the geographic distribution of total number of terrorism attackes in each year. Besides, we are also curious about the the type and attackes of terrorism attackes.
