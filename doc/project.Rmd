# Introduction (including choice of data, questions), Team description


# Description of Data

We get the dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) http://start.umd.edu/gtd/, which is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016 (with annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other event databases, the GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 170,000 cases. The dataset ends in 2016 because GTD collection beyond 2016 is ongoing and the website is updated annually. They expect to release the 2017 data in Summer 2018. 

Statistical information contained in the Global Terrorism Database is based on reports from a variety of open media sources. Information is not added to the GTD unless and until we have determined the sources are credible. We should not infer any additional actions or results beyond what is presented in a GTD entry and specifically, we should not infer an individual associated with a particular incident was tried and convicted of terrorism or any other criminal offense. If new documentation about an event becomes available, an entry may be modified, as necessary and appropriate.

In our project, we divide the whole dataset into two subgroups: the data in 1970 to 1974 and 2012-2016. For the dataset from 1970-1974, there are 2670 observations of 135 variables. For the dataset from 2011-2016, there are 2670 observations of 135 variables. We would like to carry out data visualizatioin and data analysis on these subgroups individually and compare their performances. For example, we would like to know the difference in the total number of terrorist attacks by region and by year, which may be related to the policy issues, motivations and religions, etc.

+ Characteristics of the data
 - Contains information on over 170,000 terrorist attacks
 - Currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world
 - Includes information on more than 83,000 bombings, 18,000 assassinations, and 11,000 kidnappings since 1970
 - Includes information on at least 45 variables for each case, with more recent incidents including information on more - than 120 variables
 - Over 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to collect incident data from 1998 to 2016 alone



# Graphical Analysis of Data Quality

```{r}
terrorism <- read.xlsx("../data/raw data/globalterrorismdb_0617dist.xlsx")
terrorism1<-terrorism[terrorism$iyear<=1974,]
#write.csv(terrorism1,"terrorism1.csv")
terrorism2<-terrorism[terrorism$iyear>=2012,]
#write.csv(terrorism2,"terrorism2.csv")
```


## Discover what's in the data file that was exported
```{r}
head(terrorism)
nrow(terrorism)
```
The imported dataset contains information about terrorist attacks around the world in different fields.From the table above, we can search for the occurance time, occurance location, attack type, attack target and other significant information of terrorist incidents. All in all, it has over 170,000 records (number of terrorist incidents) with 135 kinds of variabes. 
The original dataset has a time range from 1970 to 2015, but in our project we make 2 subsets from the dataset -- one period is from 1970 to 1974, another one is from 2012 to 2016.  Because the whole dataset is too large and complex, we cannot get satisfactory results if we are lack of orientation. So eventually we decided to select these two periods as samples and comparison groups to conduct our research. After sebsetting, we have 68,366 records now. 

```{r}
combine <- subset(terrorism, iyear<=1974 | iyear>=2012)
nrow(combine)
terrorism_ <- combine[,c("iyear","imonth", "iday", "country_txt", "region_txt", "provstate", "city", "latitude", "longitude", "attacktype1_txt", "targtype1_txt")]
```

## Imputations for NULL values 
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=20}
visna(combine, sort = "b")
visna(terrorism_, sort = "b")
```
The first picture is based on the subdataset that we selected from the two time period we mentioned above, which contains all kinds of variables in the original dataset. This graph discribes the condition of missing values. we can conclude that actually the datasets have lots of missing values, but they do not have a unbiased distribution, which means some categotries of variables are full of missing values, but conversely, another parts of categories do not have any missing values. 
In the second graph, we pick up some of the variables we like to use in our project, and make another missing value discription. We find that in the domains that we feel interested in, the dataset is satisfactory and complete, and we do not need to worry about the biase from missing values. 

## Outlier Analysis and Treatment
```{r}
boxplot(imonth ~ iyear, data=terrorism1, main="Quantity of Terrorist Incidents in each Month across Years 1970-1974")  
boxplot(iday ~ imonth, data=terrorism1, main="Quantity of Terrorist Incidents in each Day across Months 2012-2016") 
boxplot(imonth ~ iyear, data=terrorism2, main="Quantity of Terrorist Incidents in each Month across Years 1970-1974")  
boxplot(iday ~ imonth, data=terrorism2, main="Quantity of Terrorist Incidents in each Day across Months 2012-2016") 
```
We conclude that we don't have outliers according to the boxplots. In each month, terrorist attacks occured averagely, and in each year of the period we sampled, terrorist attacks also occured almost averagely. 

# Main Analysis (focus on quality of EDA choices / techniques)

## A heatmap of total number of terrorist attacks worldwide 

To compare the total number of terrorist attacks worldwide, we draw the following two heatmaps. 
```{r}

a <- rle(sort(terrorism1$country_txt))
b <- data.frame(country_txt=a$values, number_of_torrorism_attacks_from_1970_to_1974 = a$lengths)

gtdMap <- joinCountryData2Map( b, 
                               nameJoinColumn="country_txt", 
                               joinCode="NAME" )


mapCountryData( gtdMap, 
                nameColumnToPlot='number_of_torrorism_attacks_from_1970_to_1974',
                catMethod='fixedWidth', 
                numCats=100 )

a <- rle(sort(terrorism2$country_txt))
b <- data.frame(country_txt=a$values, number_of_torrorism_attacks_from_2012_to_2016 = a$lengths)

gtdMap <- joinCountryData2Map( b, 
                               nameJoinColumn="country_txt", 
                               joinCode="NAME" )

#mapDevice('x11')
mapCountryData( gtdMap, 
                nameColumnToPlot='number_of_torrorism_attacks_from_2012_to_2016', 
                catMethod='fixedWidth', 
                numCats=100 )


```

In order to visualize the total number of terrorist attacks throughout the years, we also draw a supplementary line chart to facilitate comparison.

```{r}
#attack trends 1970-1974
year_1970_1974 <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(iyear) %>% summarise(n=n())
p1<-ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n), data = year_1970_1974) + geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("terrorist Attacks Number") + ggtitle("Global Terrorist Attacks From 1970 To 1974") 

#attack trends 2012-2016
year_2012_2016 <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(iyear) %>% summarise(n=n())
p2<-ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n), data = year_2012_2016) + geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("terrorist Attacks Number") + ggtitle("Global Terrorist Attacks From 2012 To 2016") 

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

From the plot above, although the trends are different between these two periods, there has been a noticable increase on terrorist attacks number during the recent years compared with the 70s. During 2012-2016, the maximum number of attacks was around 17000, and the minimum numbre of attacks was around 8500. While during 1970-1974, the maximum number was only 650. This indicates that there have been more unstable factors around the globe in recent years and the world has been more dangerous now than in the 70s. 


## Terrorist Attack Tactics Wordwide, 1970-1974; 2012-2016

We then want to explore what kinds of attacks were occured during these years.
```{r}
#1970-1974
attacktype_1970_1974 <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt) %>% summarise(n=n())
p1<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(attacktype1_txt, n), y=n), data=attacktype_1970_1974) + 
geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + xlab('Attack Type') + ylab('Number of Attacks') + ggtitle('Global Terrorist Attack Types From 1970 To 1974') + coord_flip() 

#2012-2016
attacktype_2012_2016 <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt) %>% summarise(n=n())
p2<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(attacktype1_txt, n), y=n), data=attacktype_2012_2016) + 
geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + xlab('Attack Type') + ylab('Number of Attacks') + ggtitle('Global Terrorist Attack Types From 2012 To 2016') + coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

From the above bar chart, we can see that Bombing/Explosion has been the most frequently used method of terrorist attack both during 1970-1974 and 2012-2016. Armed Assault, Assassination, Hostage Taking (kidnapping) and Facility/Infrastructure have also been some of the most frequently used terrorist attack method for both period. 


## Terrorist Attack Targets in 1970 and 2016

There are a lot of different terrorist attack targets in our dataset, such as Government, Military, Education Institutions and so on. We would like to compare the top 10 terrorist attack targets in the first 1970 and the last year 2016 in our dataset. The variation in terrorist attack targets may be related to the policy issues, motivations and religions, etc.
```{r,fig.height=5,fig.width=10, fig.align='center'}

attack1970 <- terrorism[terrorism$iyear==1970, ]
by_target <- attack1970 %>% group_by(targtype1_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
by_target <- arrange(by_target, desc(n))%>% head(10)

p1<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(targtype1_txt, n), y=n), data=by_target) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + ggtitle('Attack Targets, 1970') +
  coord_flip() + theme_fivethirtyeight()

attack2016 <- terrorism[terrorism$iyear==2016, ]
by_target <- attack2016 %>% group_by(targtype1_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
by_target <- arrange(by_target, desc(n))%>% head(10)

p2<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(targtype1_txt, n), y=n), data=by_target) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + ggtitle('Attack Targets, 2016') +
  coord_flip() + theme_fivethirtyeight()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

The diversity of terrorist attack targets is higher in 2016 than in 1970. The biggest difference is that private citizens and properties become the highest terrorist attack targets in 2016, which does not even appear among the top 10 terrorist attack targets in 1970. This may because the personal hatred is developing rapidly among these years.

For the top 10 terrorist attack targets, they require the most homeland security resources. Policymakers can use these and other results to focus their counter-terrorism measures.


## Which cities were the most dangerous in  1970-1974 and 2012-2016

Then, we want to explore deeper to see the difference in the most dangerous cities in 1970-1974 and 2012-2016.  They ranked among the world's most dangerous places on the basis of total number of terrorism attacks.
```{r,fig.height=6,fig.width=9, fig.align='center'}
attack_by_city <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(country_txt, city) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
attack_by_city <- arrange(attack_by_city, desc(n))
top10_city<- head(attack_by_city, 10)

p1<-ggplot(data=top10_city, aes(x=reorder(city,-n), y=n, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point() + xlab("City") + ylab("Number of terrorist Attacks") +
        ggtitle("Top 10 dangerous city by Year 1970-1974") + theme_fivethirtyeight()

attack_by_city <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(country_txt, city) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
attack_by_city <- arrange(attack_by_city, desc(n))
top10_city<- head(attack_by_city, 10)

p2<-ggplot(data=top10_city, aes(x=reorder(city,-n), y=n, group=1)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point() + xlab("City") + ylab("Number of terrorist Attacks") +
        ggtitle("Top 10 dangerous city by Year 2012-2016") + theme_fivethirtyeight()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

The most dangeours countries are very different in these two periods. During 1970-1974, the most dangerous countries are in United Kingdom, United States, Argentina, Uruguay and Turkey. Belfast was the most dangerous city in 1970-1974, with approximately 400 terrorist attacks in all.

During 2012-2016, the most dangerous countries are in Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen. Baghdad was the most dangerous city in 2012-2016, with approximately 4000 terrorist attacks in all. In addition, the total number of attacks increased rapidly, which may be caused by wars and other political issues.


## Which regions were the most dangerous in  1970-1974 and 2012-2016

Since we have already explored terrorist attack methods and targets in previous analyzation, we also want to know which regions have been targetted the most. 
```{r}
#1970-1974
region_1970_1974 <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(region_txt) %>% summarise(n=n())
p1<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(region_txt, n), y=n), data=region_1970_1974) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + xlab('Region') + ylab('Number of Terrorist Attacks From 1970 To 1974') + ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks Region From 1970 to 1974') + coord_flip()

#2012-2016
region_2012_2016 <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(region_txt) %>% summarise(n=n())
p2<-ggplot(aes(x=reorder(region_txt, n), y=n), data=region_2012_2016) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + xlab('Region') + ylab('Number of Terrorist Attacks From 2011 To 2016') + ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks Region From 2012 to 2016') + coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)

```

The region of terrorist attacks has also changed a lot in the past decades. During 1970-1974, the region with most terrorist attacks was Western Europe, followed by North America, South America, Middle East & North Afica etc,. While during 2012-2016, Middle East & North Afica has become the region with most number of terrorist attacks, followed by South Asia, Sub-Saharan African, Southeast Asia etc,. The change may cause by the unstable political or other situation in the Middle East and North Afica region and the dramatic change in the world pattern in the past 30 years.


## Terrorist Attacks distribution by Region and Year 1970-1974 & 2012-2016

We also feel curious about the distribution worldwide by region in each year of both of the time ranges,'1970-1974'and'2012-2016'. On the basis of this series of barcharts, we can know more about the questions like: 'if the terrorist attack distribution of each year inside each time range is similar with each other?' or 'if there is any major differences between the 2 time ranges in terrorrist attacks distribution by region?'
To solve these problems, we built up the barcharts below. 
```{r}
#terrorism1970 <- read.csv('../data/terrorism1.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
#terrorism2012 <- read.csv('../data/terrorism2.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
```
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=10}

combine <- subset(terrorism, iyear<=1974 | iyear>=2012)
by_year <- combine %>% group_by(iyear,region_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(by_year, aes(x = region_txt, y = n, fill = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  facet_wrap(~iyear) + xlab('Year') + coord_flip() +
  ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks by Region and Year 1970-1974 & 2012-2016') + 
  theme(legend.position="none")

by_year <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(iyear,region_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(by_year, aes(x = region_txt, y = n, fill = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  facet_wrap(~iyear) + xlab('Year') + coord_flip() +
  ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks by Region and Year 1970-1974') + 
  theme(legend.position="none")

by_year <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(iyear,region_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(by_year, aes(x = region_txt, y = n, fill = n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  facet_wrap(~iyear) + xlab('Year') + coord_flip() +
  ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks by Region and Year 2012-2016') + 
  theme(legend.position="none")
```
From the graphs above, we can conclude that compared with 40 years ago, the world is obviuosly more dangerous. In the era of 1970s, America and Western Europe are the most dangerous regions throughout the world, while in the ear of 2010s, Middle East, North Africa and South Asia already became the target regions of terrorrists, which means, the patterns have been subverted completely.

Simultaneously, we plotted pie charts to compare the contribution of each region for the occurance of terrorist attacks in the world. 
```{r}
NAmericadist <- terrorism1 %>% group_by(region_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
rgb.palette <- colorRampPalette(c(rgb(230,247,255,max=255),rgb(35,179,225,max=255)),space = "rgb")

bp<- ggplot(NAmericadist, aes(x="", y=n, fill=region_txt))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=rgb.palette(11)) 
pie <- bp + coord_polar("y", start=0)
pie + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(),axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks Distribution by Region and Year 1970-1974') 

ramp <- colorRamp(c("white", "red"))  
red <- rgb( ramp(seq(0, 1, length = 12)), max = 255)
MENAdist <- terrorism2 %>% group_by(region_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
bp2 <- ggplot(MENAdist, aes(x="", y=n, fill=region_txt))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=red) 
pie <- bp2 + coord_polar("y", start=0)
pie + theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y = element_blank()) + ggtitle('Terrorist Attacks Distribution by Region and Year 2012-2016') 
```
The pie charts above show that compared with 40 years ago, the target regions of terrorist attacks became more diverse, and the areas involved are more extensive.

## Comparison between Terrorist Attack numbers in Middle East & North Africa and North America by Year 1970-1974

On the ground of the analysis above, we want ot pay more attention to 2 major regions full of collisions during the past years, which are Middle East & North Africa and North America. Firstly we want to compare the numbers of attacks of the 2 regions in 1970-1974.
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=11}
NA_MENA <- subset(terrorism1, region_txt == "North America" | region_txt == "Middle East & North Africa")
n_NAMENA <- NA_MENA %>% group_by(region_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
cbPalette2 <- c("#999999", "#E69F00")
ggplot(n_NAMENA, aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = region_txt)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab('Year') +
  facet_wrap(~ region_txt) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette2) +
ggtitle("Comparison between Terrorist Attack numbers in Middle East & North Africa and North America by Year 1970-1974")
```

And this is the comparison during the period of 2012-2016.
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=11}
NA_MENA <- subset(terrorism2, region_txt == "North America" | region_txt == "Middle East & North Africa")
n_NAMENA <- NA_MENA %>% group_by(region_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
cbPalette2 <- c("#999999", "#E69F00")
ggplot(n_NAMENA, aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = region_txt)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab('Year') +
  facet_wrap(~ region_txt) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette2) +
ggtitle("Comparison between Terrorist Attack numbers in Middle East & North Africa and North America by Year 2012-2016")
```
The contrast is corrsponding to the conclusion we got in the last part.

## Types of Terrorist Attacks in North America and Middle East & North Africa by Year 1970-1974

Now that we know the distribution of attack numbers among years, we want to know more details about these terrorist activities. So the barchart below will show us the contribution of different attack types in a certain year and a certain region.
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=12}
cbPalette9 <- c("#000000", "#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
NorthAmerica <- terrorism1[terrorism1$region_txt=='North America', ]
NorthAmerica_type <- NorthAmerica %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = attacktype1_txt), data = NorthAmerica_type) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette9) +
ggtitle("Terrorist Attacks in North America by Year 1970-1974")

MENA <- terrorism1[terrorism1$region_txt=='Middle East & North Africa', ]
MENA_type <- MENA %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = attacktype1_txt), data = MENA_type) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette9) +  
ggtitle("Terrorist Attacks in Middle East & North Africa by Year 1970-1974")
```

For North America in 1970s, explosion occupied a large proportion of all of the attack types, and there are also lots of infrastructure attacks. On the other hand, for Middle East & North Africa in 1970s, explosion is also a major type of attacks, but other main methods of attacks are armed assault, kidnapping and Hijacking, 

## Types of Terrorist Attacks in North America and Middle East & North Africa by Year 2012-2016
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=12}
NorthAmerica <- terrorism2[terrorism2$region_txt=='North America', ]
NorthAmerica_type <- NorthAmerica %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = attacktype1_txt), data = NorthAmerica_type) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette9) +  
ggtitle("Terrorist Attacks in North America by Year 1970-1974")

MENA <- terrorism2[terrorism2$region_txt=='Middle East & North Africa', ]
MENA_type <- MENA %>% group_by(attacktype1_txt, iyear) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())
ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = n, fill = attacktype1_txt), data = MENA_type) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette9) +  
ggtitle("Terrorist Attacks in Middle East & North Africa by Year 2012-2016")
```

In comparison with 40 years ago, for North America, the percentage of explosion decreased, but infrastructure attack became the most major attack type. However, for Middle East & North Africa, the distribution has not changed a lot, and the quantity of explosion is overwelmingly large. 

## Comparison of Terrorist Attacks Distribution by Country in North America& Middle East & North Africa and Year 1970-1974&2012-2016

At present, we combine the 2 regions together to explore the contribution of each country in the 2 regions.
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=12}

It is self-evident that Iraq replaced the status of America to become the most dangerous country amoung North America& Middle East & North Africa. This probabily because of the influence of the Iraq war, and we can induce that most of risks are transferred to Middle East from United States.

## Comparison of Terrorist Attacks Distribution by Country in North America and Year 1970-1974 & 2012-2016

On the basis of this, we want to concentrate on the 2 regions separately and analyse the relative safety of countries in some region. 
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=12}
NAmerica <- subset(terrorism1, region_txt == "North America")
n_NA <- NAmerica %>% group_by(country_txt) %>% 
  summarise(n=n())

```

According to the pie charts, we found that although United States is still the most major attack target in North America, but the risks of Mexico and Canada increased evidently compared with 40 years ago. But all in all, Canada is still the safest country in North America.

For countries in Middle East & North Africa, the risks and contradictions in this region became more concentrated, which means, after several wars in this region during the past decades, great changes of security situations have taken place Middle East & North Africa.

# Executive Summary (focus on quality of presentation choices / techniques)

This project provides an analysis and evaluation of global terrorist attack during two separate time periods, 1970-1974 and 2012-2016. The main goals are analyzing the terrorist attack patterns around the world and making comparison between the chosen time periods. We gathered our data through an open source database: Global Terrorism Database (GTD) http://start.umd.edu/gtd/, and used R and Shiny to do data analysis and visualization. Methods of data analysis include important feature extraction and outliers, missing value detections. Graphical analysis includes generating line charts, bar charts, pie charts and world map to facilitate analyzation. 

The project draws attention to the fact that although the trends are different between these two periods, there has been a noticeable increase on terrorist attacks number during the recent five years compared with the 70s (Fig.1). The maximum number of terrorist attacks between 2012 
and 2016 is approximately 17000, which is almost 27 times of the maximum number between 1970 to 1974.

We also notice that among these terrorist attacks, Bombing/Explosion has become the most common tacit during both time periods (Fig.2). 

![fig2](./doc/fig/fig2.png)


What catches our eyes is that in the 70s, the main target of attacks was Business, while in the 2010s, Private Citizens & Property has become the main objective (Fig.3). This reflects that in the 70s, terrorist attacks were mainly targeted on plundering wealth, especially from department stores, banks, hotels and supermarkets (Citation: https://qz.com/558597/charted-terror-attacks-in-western-europe-from-the-1970s-to-now/). While in 2010s, terrorist attacks become more and more plebification, with lots of innocent people being killed. If the terrorist attacks in the 70s more or less had a taste of robbing the rich to assist the poor, then the attacks in the 2010s have completely degenerated into the tools of game playing between different parties. 

![fig3](./doc/fig/fig3.png)


The region that have been attacked the most changed from Western Europe to Middle East & North Africa (Fig.4). Further investigation shows that terrorist attacks in Western Europe in the 70s were mainly extremist political groups organized bombings in Western European countries, which were more likely to be a local phenomenon (Citation: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546550902950308?src=recsys&). However, nowadays, the terrorist attacks in Western Europe are more or less related to Islamist extremists. The increasing number of terrorist attacks in the Middle East region in the past few years coincides with the unstable political situation nowadays in the Middle East region, especially after the Iraq War in 2003. Countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan are also the focus of terrorists these days.

Our analysis shows that there have been great changes in the world terrorist attacks pattern between 1970-1974 and 2012-2016. Although Western Europe and North America were two of the regions with most attacks in the 70s, compared with 40 years ago, these two areas become much safer due to political and societal stabilization. Middle East & North Africa has now become the most dangerous area around the world, with a main attack tacit of Bombing and Explosion. 


# Interactive Component 

# Conclusion

In our peoject, we use the global terrorism dataset to do the data analysis and data visualization. We carried out the graphical analysis of the data quality, including imputations of NULL values, outlier analysis and treatment, etc. We then focused on different main questions and did the analysis. For example, we compared the total number of terrorist attacks worldwide, the most dangerous places, terrorist attack tactics, terrorist attack targets by year. We also compared the types of terrorism attacks and terrorism attack distribution by region, etc. In addition, we used D3 to make an interacitive data visulization of the heatmap by year.

+ We found that
 - There has been a noticable increase on terrorist attacks number during the recent years compared with the 70s.
 - Bombing/Explosion has been the most frequently used method of terrorist attack both during 1970-1974 and 2012-2016.
 - The diversity of terrorist attack targets is higher in 2016 than in 1970. The biggest difference is that private citizens and properties become the highest terrorist attack targets in 2016, which does not even appear among the top 10 terrorist attack targets in 1970.
 - The most dangeours countries are very different in these two periods. Baghdad was the most dangerous city in 2012-2016, with approximately 4000 terrorist attacks in all. 
 - The region of terrorist attacks has also changed a lot in the past decades. During 1970-1974, the region with most terrorist attacks was Western Europe. While during 2012-2016, Middle East & North Afica has become the region with most number of terrorist attacks.
 - Compared with 40 years ago, the target regions of terrorist attacks became more diverse, and the areas involved are more extensive.
 - Explosion occupied a large proportion of all of the attack types, and there are also lots of infrastructure attacks.
 - In comparison with 40 years ago, for North America, the percentage of explosion decreased, but infrastructure attack became the most major attack type. However, for Middle East & North Africa, the distribution has not changed a lot, and the quantity of explosion is overwelmingly large.
 - Although United States is still the most major attack target in North America, but the risks of Mexico and Canada increased evidently compared with 40 years ago. But all in all, Canada is still the safest country in North America.
